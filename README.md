I made this plugin for quicker date adding and editing without needing to perfectly type out the date each time. I tried using the default obsidian date picker, but I wasn't super impresssed with it so I made my own.

## Clicking on dates
![alt text](<README gifs/Clicking on dates to change them.gif>)

You can click on date in your notes to pull up the date selector. This can be disabled if you don’t want to be able to edit dates via the mouse or you want to use dates as daily notes for example.

## Mouse Control
![alt text](<README gifs/Mouse control.gif>)

After the trigger of “@”, you can pick a date with the mouse on the calendar.

## Keyboard Control

You can also insert dates without using the mouse at all. This was the main reason I made the custom calendar UI rather than the default UI that comes with Obsidian

## Date formats
![alt text](<README gifs/Different date formats.gif>)

Also supports other common date formats. The inserted date format will be based on the format selection in the settings.

### To-do:
- relative dates (i.e. tomorrow, next Friday, etc.)
